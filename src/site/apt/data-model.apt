Vocabularies Used by MSM4J

* {Minimal Service Model}

    In a nutshell, MSM is a simple RDF(S) integration ontology based on the principle of minimal ontological commitment;
    it captures the maximum common denominator between existing conceptual models for services. Thus, MSM does not aim
    to be yet another service model to bring further heterogeneity to the services landscape; it is instead an
    integration model at the intersection of existing formalisms, able to capture the core semantics of both Web services
    and Web APIs in a common model, homogeneously supporting publication and discovery.

    Minimal Service Model, denoted by the <<<msm>>> namespace in the Figure below, defines <msm:Services> which have a number of
    <Operations>. Operations in turn have <input>, <output> and <fault MessageContent> descriptions. <MessageContent>
    may be composed of <mandatory> or <optional MessageParts>.

    Driven by Semantic Web best practices, MSM builds upon existing vocabularies. The most recent version of MSM (v1.3),
    depicted in the figures, exploits the following vocabularies:

        * <SAWSDL>, using the <<<sawsdl>>> namespace;

        * <WSMO-Lite>, using the <<<wl>>> namespace;

        * <hRESTS>, using the <<<hr>>> namespace;

        * <DC Terms>, using the <<<dc>>> namespace;

        * <FOAF>, using the <<<foaf>>> namespace;

    In addition, MSM has some extensions that are modelled according to the minimal ontological commitment principle as well:

        * <MSM-WSDL>, which provides the MSM grounding to WSDL descriptions;

        * <MSM-Swagger>, which provides the MSM grounding to JSON descriptions defined according to Swagger specification;

        * <MSM-NFP>, which provides useful Non-Functional Properties (NFPs) of services to support Web developers, such as service provider information and social media channels.

** {New features coming for MSM 1.3}

    The next version of MSM will contain two main novelties:

        * the definition of a generic <<<msm:isGroundedIn>>> property;

        * the introduction of the <<<msm:hasFault>>> property.

    We shall be releasing this version soon.

    The <<<msm:isGroundedIn>>> property enables to capture the grounding of elements of service descriptions defined by other models, such as WSDL, SWAGGER, WSMO and OWL-S.
    In other terms, this property allows us to bind any other kind of structured service description to MSM elements, with the aim to make MSM an agnostic model for semantic annotation, leaving the technical invocation details to other specifications.

    The <<<msm:hasFault>>> property is introduced to define generic operation faults that can not be strictly related to input or output issues.
    As far we know the only specification which distinguishes between input and output fault is {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl20/#InterfaceFaultReference_ref_attribute}WSDL 2.0}}. All others simply refer to faults.
    We have retained <<<msm:hasInputFault>>> and <<<msm:hasOutputFault>>> as subproperties of <<<msm:hasFault>>> for compatibility reasons with WSDL and older MSM descriptions but now recommend using the more generic term <<<msm:hasFault>>>.
    <<<msm:hasInputFault>>> and <<<msm:hasOutputFault>>> are now tagged as <archaic> terms according to the {{{http://www.w3.org/2003/06/sw-vocab-status/note}Term-centric Semantic Web Vocabulary Annotations}} and their removal may be considered in the future.

* {SAWSDL}

    The {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/sawsdl/}SAWSDL}} vocabulary provides three properties, namely <<<sawsdl:modelReference>>>, <<<sawsdl:liftingSchemaMapping>>> and <<<sawsdl:loweringSchemaMapping>>>.
    These properties enable one to link existing descriptions to semantic models (modelReference) as to scripts able to
    transform diverse serialisations into their semantic counter part and vice versa.

* {WSMO-Lite}

    The {{{http://www.wsmo.org/ns/wsmo-lite/}WSMO-Lite}} vocabulary completes MSM by providing classes for describing the main service semantics and by
    supplying type information to the generic model references. In particular, WSMO-Lite captures non-functional
    semantics through the concept of <<<wl:NonfunctionalParameter>>>, and functional semantics via the concepts <<<wl:Condition>>>,
    <<<wl:Effect>>>, and <<<wl:FunctionalClassificationRoot>>>.

* {hRESTS}

    {{{http://iserve.kmi.open.ac.uk/ns/hrests}hRESTS}} on the other hand provides basic support for capturing grounding information necessary for Web APIs. This
    vocabulary, see Figure below, therefore covers aspects such as URL templates, HTTP methods used, etc

[images/data-model-http-grounding.png] <hRESTS> extension to cover grounding for Web APIs.

    The current version of <hRESTS> (v1.2) exploits terms from the {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/HTTP-in-RDF10/}HTTP RDF vocabulary}} to define the HTTP methods used by operations.


* {MSM-WSDL}

    {{{http://iserve.kmi.open.ac.uk/ns/msm-wsdl}MSM-WSDL}} provides one simple property, <<<msm-wsml:isGroundedIn>>>, which enables us to capture the grounding of elements of a
    service description into the actual WSDL element that defines it. This property essentially
    provides us back and forth navigation from MSM service descriptions into WSDL files as necessary to
    carry out invocation for example.

    For the current <MSM-WSDL> version (v0.2), the WSDL element should be specified according to a WSDL {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-wsdl11elementidentifiers-20070131/#wsdl-iri-references}1.1}}
    or {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/2005/WD-wsdl20-20050803/#wsdl-iri-references}2.0}} IRI-references syntax defined by a
    {{{http://www.w3.org/TR/xptr-framework/}XPointer}} expression.

* {MSM-NFP}

    {{{http://iserve.kmi.open.ac.uk/ns/msm-nfp}MSM-NFP}} is a <MSM> extension that aims to support the description of basic NFPs.
    The current version of <MSM-NFP> (v0.1) focuses on the definition of properties which provide relevant information for developers which integrate services in their own applications.

    To inform developers of the usage of a service, <<<msm-nfp:hasTotalMashups>>> and <<<msm-nfp:hasRecentMashups>>> properties has been defined.
    The two properties respectively define the total number and the recent amount of mashups in which a Web API is a component.

    A Web API can have a forum to support developer issues. This information can be specified through the <<<msm-nfp:hasForum>>> property, which has
    the <<<sioc:Forum>>> class, from the {{{http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/}SIOC vocabulary}}, as range.
    <MSM-NFP> specifies also a measurement of the forum vitality, as average of daily users that post messages, through the <<<msm-nfp:hasVitality>>>.
    This measure can be useful for developers to figure out the promptness of the forum community to support users issues.

    Measures of service provider popularity can be specified by the <<<msm-nfp:hasPopularity>>> property as a numeric value.
    The <<<schema:Organization>>> and <<<schema:Person>>> classes, defined by the {{{http://schema.rdfs.org/}Schema.org vocabulary}},
    are the domain of the <<<msm-nfp:hasPopularity>>> property. These two classes allow us to define a service provider which is associated with
    a service through the <<<schema:provider>>> property.

    A provider, defined as a <<<foaf:Agent>>>, can have a Twitter account as a means to provide updates about his Web APIs.
    A Twitter account is an instance of the <<<msm-nfp:TwitterAccount>>> class (subclass of <<<foaf:OnlineAccount>>>) which is a associated to a provider by
    the <<<msm-nfp:hasTwitterAccount>>> property (subproperty of <<<foaf:account>>>).

* {Others}

    Both {{{http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/}DC Terms}} and {{{http://www.foaf-project.org/}FOAF}} provide general support to capture metadata such as a textual description, the
    creator of a service description, etc.
    {{{http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/}SIOC vocabulary}} provides the main concepts and properties required to describe information from online communities, such as wikis, weblogs and forums.
    Finally, {{{http://schema.rdfs.org/}Schema.org}} is a collection of terms that webmasters can use to markup their pages, which is introduced by Bing, Google and Yahoo! to improve the display of search engine results.
