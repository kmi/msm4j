Compiling MSM4J

    MSM4J is developed in Java and is entirely managed by Maven both for compilation and testing.
    Below you have a quick reference on how to compile it.

* Requirements

    * Maven 3+.

    * SWS Test Collections for testing (dependency will soon be dropped).


* Obtaining the code

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 git clone https://github.com/kmi/msm4j.git
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

* Compiling

    Compiling will require having a local installed version of {{{https://github.com/kmi/sws-test-collections}SWS-Test-Collections}} (for testing). Since we currently do not publish this jar on public registries, you will have to compile and install it manually.
    We certainly plan to simplify this process but until then, do not fear, it is fairly easy.

    Once you have this locally you will be able to ensure that all the tests of MSM4J can run. If you wish to skip these tests you can always use '-DskipTests=true' when compiling.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 mvn clean install
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


* Generating the Documentation

    The source code of MSM4J also includes this documentation so you may keep it handy locally. To generate it:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 mvn site:site
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    To view the resulting documentation:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 mvn site:run
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    The documentation will be available at {{{http://localhost:10000} http://localhost:10000}}
